### FAQ:

<div className="text-sm">
#### How are sync-minutes counted?

Sync-minutes are counted on a **per-connected-device, per-minute basis.**<br/>
A device is considered syncing **only when it's actively sending or receiving data.**

#### How can I estimate my usage?

The best way to estimate your usage is to **guess how many minutes per month each user will spend actively using your app.**
Storage is mostly determined by large binary blobs (like images or videos) that you store in Jazz.

#### What happens if I exceed my plan's limits?

All limits are initially soft limits, so don't worry if you suddenly get lots of users or traffic!

Sync beyond the limit is still served, but at a lower priority.
Data beyond the storage limit is still stored and backed up, but may be significantly slower to access.
If you exceed your plan's limits consistently, we'll reach out to discuss upgrading your plan.

## Custom Deployment Scenarios

<Slogan small>You can rely on Jazz Mesh. But you don't have to.</Slogan>

<p>
    Because Jazz is open-source, you can optionally run your own sync nodes
    &mdash; in a variety of setups.
</p>

<Grid>
<GridCard>
#### Jazz Mesh + Data Backup Node.

<p className="no-prose text-base">
    Connect your users to Jazz Mesh for all its benefits, but also run and
    connect your own data backup node (just in case.)
</p>

<div className="text-sm">
Extra costs:
- Instance costs for the backup node.
- Moderate self-hosted storage costs.
- Your backup node is counted as a continously connected device.
</div>
</GridCard>
<GridCard>
#### Jazz Mesh + DIY Mesh.

<p className="no-prose text-base">
    Connect your users to Jazz Mesh, or your own nodes as a lower-performance
    fallback. The two networks stay in constant sync.
</p>

<div className="text-sm">
Extra costs:
- N × instance cost for your sync nodes.
- Typically moderate self-hosted egress costs.
- High self-hosted storage costs.
- Any of your sync nodes connected to Jazz Mesh is counted as a continously connected device.
</div>
</GridCard>
<GridCard>
#### Completely DIY Mesh.

<p className="no-prose text-base">
    Build your own network of sync and storage nodes. Handle networking,
    security and backups yourself.
</p>

<div className="text-sm">
Costs:
- N × instance cost for your sync nodes.
- Very high self-hosted egress costs.
- High self-hosted storage costs.
