Let your UI drive data-syncing.

- Load and auto-subscribe to deeply nested CoValues with a reactive hook (or callback).
- Access properties & metadata as plain JSON.
- Make granular changes with simple mutators.
- No queries needed, everything loads on-demand: `profile?.tweets?.map(tweet => tweet?.text)`
