            To give you sync and secure collaborative data instantly on a global
            scale, we&rsquo;re running Jazz Mesh. It works with any Jazz-based
            app, requires no setup and has straightforward, scale-to-zero
            pricing.
          </p>
          <p className="">
            Jazz Mesh is currently free â€” and it&rsquo;s set up as the default
            sync & storage peer in Jazz, letting you start building multi-user
            apps with persistence right away, no backend needed.
