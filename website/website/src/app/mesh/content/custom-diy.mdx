Connect your users to Jazz Mesh, or your own nodes as a lower-performance fallback. The two networks stay in constant sync.

Extra costs:

- N Ã— instance cost for your sync nodes.
- Typically moderate self-hosted egress costs.
- High self-hosted storage costs.
- Any of your sync nodes connected to Jazz Mesh is counted as a continously connected device.
